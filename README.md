# clearClipboarder
is a tool to help you manage your clipboard

### Supported Platforms
Windows - 100% - On Windows, no additional modules are needed other than pyperclip.<br>
macOS - Should be 100% - clearClipboarder uses the pyperclip module, which makes use of the pbcopy and pbpaste commands, thay should come with the OS.<br>
Linux - Same for macOS. If clearClipboard doesn't work, run "sudo apt-get install xclip" or "sudo apt-get install xsel" (Note: xsel does not always seem to work.)<br>
Otherwise on Linux, you will need the qtpy or PyQT5 modules installed.
